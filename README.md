# React Router: Missing Route for Unmatched Paths

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 when handling unmatched routes.  The application lacks a route to handle cases where the user navigates to a path that doesn't have a corresponding Route element defined.  This often results in unexpected behavior like rendering nothing or causing the app to crash.

## Problem:

The provided `App.js` demonstrates a simple React Router setup but misses a catch-all route (`/*`) to handle scenarios where the user enters a URL that isn't explicitly defined. This leads to issues in production environments when users enter wrong URL paths.
